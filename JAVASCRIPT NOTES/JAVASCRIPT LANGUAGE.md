 # JAVA LANGUAGE LESSON 1

## WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT ?

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

 - JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
 - Designed for creating network-centric applications.
 - Complementary to and integrated with Java.
 - Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
 - Open and cross-platform

## SYNTAX

JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.

The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.

```
<script ...>
   JavaScript code
</script>
```

The script tag takes two important attributes 

 - **Language** − This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.

 - **Type** − This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".

So your JavaScript segment will look like −

```
<script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
   JavaScript code
</script>
```

### Your First JavaScript Code

Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//-->". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. Next, we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document.

This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.

```
<html>
   <body>   
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //-->
      </script>      
   </body>
</html>
```

This code will produce the following result;

```
Hello World!
```


## PLACEMENT

There is a flexibility given to include JavaScript code anywhere in an HTML document. However the most preferred ways to include JavaScript in an HTML file are as follows;

 - Script in (<head>...</head>) section.

 - Script in <body>...</body> section.

 - Script in <body>...</body> and <head>...</head> sections.

 - Script in an external file and then include in <head>...</head> section.

In the following section, we will see how we can place JavaScript in an HTML file in different ways.


### JavaScript in <head>...</head>

If you want to have a script run on some event, such as when a user clicks somewhere, then you will place that script in the head as follows;

```
<html>
   <head>      
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            function sayHello() {
               alert("Hello World")
            }
         //-->
      </script>     
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello" />
   </body>  
</html>
```

### JavaScript in <body>...</body>

If you need a script to run as the page loads so that the script generates content in the page, then the script goes in the <body> portion of the document. In this case, you would not have any function defined using JavaScript. Take a look at the following code.

```
<html>
   <head>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World")
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <p>This is web page body </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript in <body> and <head>

You can put your JavaScript code in <head> and <body> section altogether as follows −

```
<html>
   <head>
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            function sayHello() {
               alert("Hello World")
            }
         //-->
      </script>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World")
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello" />
   </body>
</html>
```
