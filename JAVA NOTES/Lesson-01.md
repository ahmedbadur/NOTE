# JAVA LANGUAGE LESSON 1

## RUNNING PROCESS OF JAVA

 - Java codes are stored inside .java files.
 - Java source codes are first compiled into bytecodes.
 - Bytecodes are stored in .class files.
 - The generated bytecodes are interpreted by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and run by converting them into commands suitable for the operating system.

### JDK, IRE, JVM

 - **JDK**: It is a library package that allows us to compile and run our applications written in Java and contains many classes and libraries.
 - **JRE**: It is used to run software developed with Java. It is automatically installed when we install the JDK.
 - **JVM**: It is a virtual machine that interprets bytecodes and makes them suitable for the operating system. It comes with the JRE.
